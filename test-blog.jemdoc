== Why is Grothendieck's inequality true? 


The purpose of this post is to discuss Grothendieck's inequality, which we state in the following form:

*Theorem 1.* 
There is a universal constant \( K \) with the following property: let \( a_{ij} \) be an \( n\times n \) matrix and suppose that \[\sup_{|s_i|\leq 1, |t_j|\leq 1} \left| \sum_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij}s_i t_j\right|\leq 1.\] Then \[\sup_{\|x_i\|\leq 1, \|y_j\|\leq 1} \left| \sum_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij}\langle x_i, y_j\rangle_H \right|\leq K\]
where the \(x_i\) and \(y_j\) are vectors in a Hilbert space \(H\).

The theorem is true over both the real and complex fields, though with different values of the universal constants \(K_G^{\mathbb R}\) and \(K_G^{\mathbb C}\) (known as the /Grothendieck constants/. There are many proofs of Grothendieck's inequality available; in this post I'd like to discuss one of them, due essentially to Andrew Tonge, which (although it does not produce the best values of \(K_G\)) has the advantage of being conceptually very simple, so that I even I can understand it. That is, it's one of those proofs that, once you've read it, you feel like you actually understand why the theorem is true.
